### Profile
**Maxwell (Max) Garcia** is a first-year MURP student concentrating in Design and Development and participating in the Double Degree Program with Sciences Po in Paris. He is excited to improve his GIS skills and understand how coding languages can shape the program's interface (he has limited experience with other languages and no knowledge of Python). In particular, he hopes to use what he learns in this class to study issues related to climate resilience planning, affordable housing, multi-modal transportation, and urban politics around the world.
